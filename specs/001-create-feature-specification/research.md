# Research: Web Support Bot

**Feature**: Web Support Bot
**Date**: 2025-10-03

## Summary
No research was required for this feature as the technical context was clear and all decisions were made based on the existing project structure and constitution.

## Decisions

### Language and Dependencies
- **Decision**: Use Dart ^3.9.0 with the `args` and `pocketflow` packages.
- **Rationale**: This aligns with the project's existing technology stack and the feature's requirements to build a CLI application that uses a RAG system.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as the technology stack is already defined.

### Architecture
- **Decision**: A single project structure will be used for this CLI application.
- **Rationale**: This is the standard structure for this project and is appropriate for a self-contained CLI tool.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as the project structure is already defined.
