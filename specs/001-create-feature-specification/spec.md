# Feature Specification: Web Support Bot

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-feature-specification`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create feature specification from the existing design document at docs/design.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to ask questions in natural language about a website's content and receive a comprehensive answer compiled from multiple pages, so that I can find information efficiently without having to manually search the site.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user provides a starting URL and asks "What are your return policies?", **When** the bot crawls the site, **Then** it should provide a consolidated answer based on content from pages like the FAQ, support docs, and relevant policy pages.
2. **Given** a user is on an e-commerce site and asks "What's the weather like today?", **When** the bot processes the question, **Then** it must politely refuse to answer as it is irrelevant to the website's content.
3. **Given** a user has asked an initial question, **When** they ask a follow-up question like "What about for international orders?", **Then** the bot must use the context of the previous conversation to provide a relevant answer.
4. **Given** a set of starting URLs, **When** the bot begins its process, **Then** it must be able to fetch and process content from multiple URLs simultaneously.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a provided URL is broken or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle questions where no relevant information can be found on the website?
- What happens if the bot gets into a loop exploring linked pages?
- How does the system handle very large web pages or websites with thousands of links?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST accept one or more starting URLs and an initial user question as input.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to crawl web pages, extract their text content, and identify all hyperlinks.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST maintain a history of the conversation to understand the context of follow-up questions.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST use an intelligent agent to decide between three actions: (1) answer the question with available information, (2) explore additional links to find more information, or (3) refuse to answer an irrelevant question.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST process multiple URLs in batches for efficient crawling.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST have a configurable limit for the maximum number of exploration iterations to prevent infinite loops.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow specifying a set of allowed domains for crawling.
- **FR-008**: The final answer provided to the user MUST be based on the content retrieved from the website.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Webpage**: Represents a single URL with its extracted text content and a list of links it contains.
- **Question**: The user's query.
- **Answer**: The bot's response, which could be a direct answer, a clarification, or a refusal.
- **Conversation**: A record of the back-and-forth between the user and the bot.
